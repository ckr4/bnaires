A billion is a very big number. So big, in fact, that it's just about impossible 
  to wrap your head around. That doesn't really matter most of the time, but when it
  comes to wealth inequality, understanding the sheer scale of that number matters. 
  So, to provide some perspective on just how much money a billion dollars is, this
  tool provides a series of visualizations of the scale of the wealth of the world's
  richest people were it to be held in physical currency, specifically, in some 
  denomination of dollar bills.
  
If you've ever wondered how heavy 150 billion dollars in hundred dollar bills
  would be, expressed in terms of Saturn V rockets, or how high a stack of that many
  bills would reach - tip: think miles, not feet - or how far they'd stretch when
  laid end-to-end, which is going to blow your mind, you're in luck.
  
Also, just for fun, you can compare the world's current 25 richest people with
  some of the richest individuals in history, excluding rulers and others who derived
  their wealth from their positions in government, and the richest fictional characters 
  ever. How does Elon Musk compare to Andrew Carnegie or John D. Rockefeller. Does 
  Scrooge McDuck, a cartoon caricature of greed, have more money than Jeff Bezos, a 
  real-life caricature of greed? Is Carlisle Cullen, a vampire who's been collecting 
  compound interest for hundreds of years, as rich as a modern day Croesus?
 
 The answers await.
